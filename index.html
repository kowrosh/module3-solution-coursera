It consists of 50 states, a federal district, five major self-governing territories, and various possessions. The capital is Washington, D.C., and the most populous city is New York City. The United States is the world's third- or fourth-largest country by total area and is slightly smaller than the entire continent of Europe. With a population of more than 331 million people, it is the third most populous country in the world. The national motto, "In God We Trust," was adopted in 1956, while the phrase "E Pluribus Unum" (Latin for "Out of many, one") was adopted in 1782 as a de facto motto. The United States became the world's leading industrial power at the turn of the 20th century due to an outburst of entrepreneurship in the Northeast and Midwest and the arrival of millions of immigrant laborers and their families from Europe. The United States ranks high in international measures of economic freedom, having the world's highest GDP nominal and third-highest GDP by PPP. Though it has a mixed economy, it controls many key industries and a small percentage of the world's industrial capacity. The United States is a highly developed country, with the world's largest economy by nominal GDP and second-largest economy by PPP, accounting for approximately a quarter of global GDP. The United States ranks among the highest nations in several measures of socioeconomic performance, including average wage, human development, per capita GDP, and productivity per person. It's known for its technological innovation, aerospace, and military prowess.</p>
